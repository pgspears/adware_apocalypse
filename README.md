# Adware Apocalypse '99: Enhanced Chaos Edition

![The Horror... The Horror...](https://static.gosquared.com/images/april/clippy/icon_clippy_01.png)

A lovingly crafted digital PTSD simulator for anyone who survived the internet of the late 1990s. Experience the thrill of a 128MB RAM computer infected with every piece of adware known to man, all within a single, horrifying HTML file.

## What is This Digital Nightmare?

This project is a time capsule of pure, unfiltered dial-up-era suffering. It recreates the authentic user experience of trying to browse the web when your screen was a battlefield, and the enemy was an army of pop-ups, parasitic toolbars, and deeply unhelpful virtual assistants.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to survive the Y2K apocalypse while your system's integrity is under constant assault from a GeoCities-inspired hellscape. May the CTRL+ALT+DEL be with you.

## Features

*   **Infinite Pop-ups:** Just when you think you've closed one, three more appear. Some have fake close buttons!
*   **Parasitic Toolbars:** Your browser's precious screen real estate will be consumed by toolbars offering free smileys, weather updates, and a purple monkey.
*   **AI Assistants:** Get "help" from **Flippy**, the deeply patronizing paperclip, and **Bonzi Buddy**, the spyware-riddled purple gorilla.
*   **Era-Authentic Visuals:** Experience the glory of `Comic Sans MS`, `marquee` text, `blink` tags, and a desktop that degrades as your system integrity fails.
*   **Powerful Super-Weapons:** Unleash devastating "Nuke" buttons to clear the screen, or "Enter The Matrix" to slow down the chaos.
*   **Achievements & Easter Eggs:** Discover hidden achievements and easter eggs, like the bouncing DVD logo and the dreaded Y2K bug.
*   **Dynamic Audio Engine:** Featuring procedurally generated sounds for dial-up modems, system errors, and the iconic "You've Got Mail!" announcement.

## How to Play

### The Goal
Survive for as long as possible. Your health is the **System Integrity** bar. When it hits 0%, it's game over, and you're greeted by the infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).

### Controls
*   **Mouse:** Your primary weapon for closing pop-ups and clicking things you *definitely* shouldn't.
*   **Nuke Buttons (Bottom-Left):** Your panic buttons for when things get out of hand. They are on a cooldown after use.

### Understanding the UI (Scoreboard)
*   **Time:** How long you've survived the apocalypse.
*   **System Integrity:** Your PC's health bar. It drains based on CPU/RAM usage. Closing pop-ups restores a little bit of it.
*   **CPU / RAM:** These increase with every pop-up and toolbar. The higher they are, the faster your integrity drains.
*   **Score:** Increases with survival time and by successfully closing pop-ups and clearing toolbars.

### The Enemies
*   **Pop-ups:** The foot soldiers of the apocalypse. Click to close them. Beware of traps!
*   **Toolbars:** These appear at the top of the browser. **DO NOT CLICK THEIR BUTTONS.** Clicking them will cause more pop-ups, drain integrity, and make your life worse.
*   **Desktop Icons:** Clicking these is a gamble. Some are traps that will unleash chaos.

### Installation
